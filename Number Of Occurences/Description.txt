Q)  You are given n different numbers and an integer k. Write a program that finds number of times k is present in log(n) time complexity.

	NOTE: YOU MUST NOT USE BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION

	WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION AND WANT YOU TRY THE LOGN SOLUTION

	USING BRUTE FORCE/LINEAR SEARCH IN THIS CASE WOULD LEAD TO DISQUALIFICATION




	Eg:	6 3		inputFormat: n,k			Ans:	3
		2 3 3 3 6 9		   : array of n elements




	Hint: Use lowerBound and upperBound technique(Binary search);
