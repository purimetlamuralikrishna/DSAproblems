Q) Happy Number
	
	
	A number is called happy if it leads to 1 after a sequence of steps wherein each step number is replaced by the sum of squares of its each 
	digit, that is if we start with Happy Number and keep replacing it with digits square sum, we reach 1.


	for eg: int n=19;
	
	1^2 + 9^2 = 82
	8^2 + 2^2 = 68
	6^2 + 8^2 = 100
	1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1;
	
	As this lead us to 1, Hence 19 is a Happy Number.
	
	eg: int n = 20; this leads to 4, Hence 20 is Not a Happy Number.

	Approch:
		
		Step1: square the each digit of the given number and sum it.
		Step2: then check the sum is equal to 1 or not.
		Step3: If step2 fails then check weather we can proceed further means can perform Step1 again.
		Step4: perform the above steps again and again until the given number becomes to single digit.
