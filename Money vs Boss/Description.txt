Q)  Description:

		You are very low on budget and want to spend minimum amount possible.

		You are going for a meeting with your boss and to reach there you have to climb a flight of stairs, but there is a catch.

		When you reach a stair, to go up from there you have to pay the price written on that stair and after that you have two options:

		You can go from step i to step i+1 or

		You can go from step i to step i+2

		Your boss also gives you an option, i.e. you can start from the stair at index 0 or index 1

		You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase.

		Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.






	Eg: 	3				Ans: 	15
		10 15 20


		10				   :	6
		1 100 1 1 1 100 1 1 100 1




	Hint: 	You will start at index 1.
		Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.The total cost is 15.


		For the second test case
		You will start at index 0.
		Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
		Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
		Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
		Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
		Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
		Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.The total cost is 6.


	Solution:	For 1st and 2nd steps minimum cost will be 0. From then we will store every step minimum cost is stored in ans array. 
			And returns the last element of ans array.
