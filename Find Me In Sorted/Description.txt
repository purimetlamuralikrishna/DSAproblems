Q)  Description:

		You are given an unsorted array of Integers

		You are also provided an index k. You have to return the position of the element stored at the kth index when the array is sorted.
		Assume stable sort in case of duplicate elements. (Using 0-based indexing)
		Note :  Sorting algorithm where in the case of a number of duplicates of a single element exists, 
		the relative order of equal elements before and after sorting the array, remains the same.
		Check the sample test case for better understanding

		Example : [ 4', 1, 4", 3, 4'" , 2, 0]  ==> stable sort [ 0,1, 2, 3, 4', 4", 4"' ]




	Eg: 	7 0				Ans: 	4
		4 1 4 3 4 2 0
	
	 	7 2				Ans: 	5
		4 1 4 3 4 2 0

		4 3					0
		4 3 2 1




	Hint: 	case 1: A = [ 4 1 4 3 4 2 0 ]  ==> stable sort A = [ 0 1 2 3 4 4 4 ] the position of A[0] becomes 4.
		case 2: A = [4 1 4 3 4 2 0 ]  ==> stable sort A = [ 0 1 2 3 4 4 4 ] the position of A[2] becomes 5.
		case 3: A = [4 3 2 1 ]  ==> stable sort A = [ 1 2 3 4 ] the position of A[3] becomes 0.
