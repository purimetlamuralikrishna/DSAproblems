Q)  Description:

	Teena is very good at competitive programming, she solved enough problems on arrays and her friend wants to test her knowledge in arrays, 
	so gave her following task :

	The problem is given an array A having N integers, for each element i (1 <= i <= N), find x+y  where x is the largest number less than i 
	such that A[x]>A[i] and y is the smallest number greater than i such that A[y]>A[i].
	If there is no x < i such that A[x]>A[i], then take x=−1. Similarly, if there is no y>i such that A[y]>A[i], then take y=−1.






	Eg: 	5				Ans: 	-2 0 6 1 3 
		5 4 1 3 2



	Hint: 	Sample 1 Explanation

		Values of x for each i: -1,1,2,2,4

		Values of y for each i: -1,-1,4,-1,-1

		So, x+y for each i: -2,0,6,1,3
