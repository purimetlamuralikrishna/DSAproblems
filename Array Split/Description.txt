Q)  Description:

	You are given a 0-indexed integer array Arr of length n.

	Arr contains a valid split at index i if the following are true:

	The sum of the first i + 1 elements is greater than or equal to the sum of the last n - i - 1 elements.
	There is at least one element to the right of i. That is, 0 <= i < n - 1.
	Find the number of valid splits in Arr.




	Examples:	4				Ans:	2
			10 4 -8 7





	Hint:
		There are three ways of splitting nums into two non-empty parts:

		Split nums at index 0. Then, the first part is [10], and its sum is 10. 
		The second part is [4,-8,7], and its sum is 3. Since 10 >= 3, i = 0 is a valid split.
		
		Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [10,4], and its sum is 14. The second part is [-8,7], and its sum is -1. 
		Since 14 >= -1, i = 1 is a valid split.

		Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [10,4,-8], and its sum is 6. The second part is [7], and its sum is 7. 
		Since 6 < 7, i = 2 is not a valid split.
		
		Thus, the number of valid splits in nums is 2.
